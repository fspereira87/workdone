Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I wouldn't say incorrect, but if we assume that with 1000000 simulations there isn't deviation, or in other words, the result will always be the same. We can conclude that with 10 000 and less simulations the results are not accurate, and tend to change per simulation between teams that have a similar rating

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would call the predictions "good enough" at 100 000 simulations. At 100 000 simulations the results present a tiny margin of variation compared with 1 000 000 simulations but with a very significant difference in time. 1 000 000 simulations take almost seven times more time to process surpassing the 7s mark when 100 000 simulations don't reach the 1s mark.
